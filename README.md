# c-programming-projects

Good day! This repository contains the coding project I have completed in the past with the C programming language. It showcases my development in Logic Formulation and the Introductory Programming of our course. 

**Project Description:**
Shirt Entrepreneur Game

You are an up-and-coming t-shirt entrepreneur, wishing to climb up the shirt selling industry and be
financially stable. However, you needed to take a loan from a local bank to start your business. You took an
initial loan of $3000, which has a daily interest rate of 3.25%. The local bank then gave you a deadline of 30
days to fully pay your debts. After paying the required fees to start a business, you are left with a measly
$700 cash on hand, which you may use before the start of your first day (i.e., Day 0).

The game starts at Day 0, wherein you can place an order on what kind and how many shirts you are going
to manufacture.
